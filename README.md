# opsafewinter
Not the simple op many think it is

When I use to be an anon, I used to participate in ops that dealt with hummane causes. One of the 
those was opsafewinter which is geared towards helping the homeless population during the winter time
when they were in their most vulnerable, to provide materials for them to survive.

It was up par as I used to give out sandwiches to them at any time in the year whenever I could and 
in selective amounts as I had very little to work with. Or, I would go overseas and go to empovish
areas to give out clothing. 

It was par of my nature to be giving in this way.

So when I heard that this op existed, I jumped at the chance. So when I donated something to the 
local homeless residents I had in my area. I used to give them an anon sticker that I would print
out from staples. They looked at it as art which I just nodded. They just apperciated someone who
took time out of their day to give them something.

However, this venue did not last long as I fell into problems with my own life and other work took
priority. 

However, that changed this year when around the fall, I was notified that some one I knew fell 
to hard times that they ended up being homeless.

<ins>*"...Everyone would rather be on the street then get robbed or raped every night."*</ins>

A friend recently echoed this statement recently.

Now to many, this quote seems farfetched. As many would say well just go to a shelter. 

But see that is also a risk too.

Its no secret due to the homeless crisis that has been happening, shelters are completely overpacked 
with people who need basic necessities. And often with the long lines, not everyone gets access to these
supplies. 

Which create a desperate situation, which creates often a target on your back if you did get said
supplies.

When I found out about the friend being homeless, I tried to help as much as I could. 
Until I couldn't. At one point, I actually recommended this friend to go to a shelter that was near 
them. I had called the staff previously before recommendation. 

The friend later ended up telling me that whatever supplies they had, it was stolen by the other people 
that were there.

I felt drained and I told this friend more than once to let me get on track first before I continue
to help. But the more drained I felt, the hopelessness creeped in and then I started to pay attention. 

It was then that I realized that its more than homeless that the friend was dealing with

<ins>*"...In many instances, substance abuse is the result of the stress of homelessness, 
rather than the other way around."*</ins>

Its no secret that with the homeless population, there's an overwheling amount of them that are more
than likely dealing with substance abuse. The most prevelant drug of choice right now is of course
fentanyl. 

Being an addict and also homeless are the worst possible condition a human being can be in. Plenty of
videos from the channel 'Soft White Underbelly' on youtube should give you a bigger picture of what
I mean from this. Hell, even one or two local homesless residents may being going through that as
we speak. 

In fact, in order to better understand the friend, I watched this channel in order for things to be
put in prespective for me. Then I recalled the memories when I seen 2 homeless people I knew OD 
from spice. 

From there, I realized that this op in paritcular was multiple ops rolled into one. 

<ins>*How to help?*</ins>

This is the toughest question to ask because how can you help is such a broad question.

- *Can I help with money?*
- *Can I help with supplies?*
- *Can I help with getting them to treatment if they are an addict?*
- *Can I help with getting them to apply for emergency housing?*

*Can I help with anything at all?*

You see in how asking that question is not all that simple.

Based on what I learned. I sort of developed a little understanding of what can be done to help. 

- Supplies

Its no secret that the homeless population need supplies. Something to eat is definately up there
that its requested and blankets. One of the things that can help you get by is prepping some sandwiches
or giving out something small to a group as first come first serve. If you see a homeless woman 
approach you, ask her if she has basic feminine hygine products. You'll be surprised as to how many
will tell you that they don't and struggle to find as such. Especially if they are in their time of
the month. 

- Shelters

If you were to ask about how the homeless population view shelters. You'll most likely get different
responses. Some of them will say that shelters do help. Some will tell you the complete opposite.
Neither side is wrong. The truth of the matter is that shelters are completely understaffed. And as
much as they try to do their best. But in some areas they still lack. If you are willing to help a
shelter out. You can. Make sure you research the shelter or the NPO to make sure they are reputable.
Be of help to the shelter, even in areas that they are vulnerable in. In helping them, you help others. 

- Addiction

More than likely with every homeless population in america. There will be some or many that are in 
some sort of drug addiction. And contrary to what many people like to think that they are violent 
and/or unstable with mental health problems. Hardly people take the time to figure out what causes 
it. There's many factors and its not solved from just one reason as to why addiction comes in to
a person's life. 

Make sure that in any point when you go and help out your local homeless population is
to carry narcan with you. More than likely there will be someone who will od on the street. 
You can save someone's life. and keep in mind, the homeless person may hate you in doing so in the
moment. But if by the miracle they get on their feet, they may be grateful to you that you did for
them, what they couldn't see for themselves then as they were escaping from their pain. 

- Listening 

You read that right. More than often, many who are homeless or homeless addicts can 
refuse all the help in the world if it isn't money. But the one thing, they have less time to 
refuse is somebody listening to them. People tend to forget that many of them
are going through things that maybe you or I can't comprhend. Now this can be dangerous in itself 
as you never know what their intentions can be. Which is why in this area you may need to carry some
type of pepper spray in case for defense. But often, it doesn't need to resort to that as some may
be open to talk. 

If you get a hint that they want to stop their addiction, guide them to find a place
where treatment is available for them. Know the local 211 number and be there for them until help is 
on the way. If they need supplies, if you have some, provide. If they wish for the word of hope, give it 
to them. Anything positive that they can ask, try to provide for them in the capabitaites that you can. 
Remember, this op is a selfless one. Treat it as such. Dress casual and simple.

- Maintain relationships with other allies.

Sometimes local businesses if open enough, can be an ally for you in this op. Obviously not all the
time but there are times when businessness can ship in and help to provide. Same can be said with NPO
or Orgs that provide free laundry and showers to the homeless population.

- Sometimes, you have to let them, help themselves.

One of the misconceptions is that every homeless person is meant to be saved. The truth is not
every homeless circumstances is the same. Your purpose should be to be an aid if in need, not to save
them from themselves. Its easy to get lost in the cause to help others. But also remember that you're
your own person too. Self-care is essential in doing this work. Its rewarding but also just as 
consuming. Pace yourself. You matter as well.  

- Follow up

Because when you follow up with a group of people who are mostly overlooked, unseen and ignored. It means
alot.

<ins>*In what not to do*</ins>

- Use the homeless population for social currency

Now this wasn't a thing before. But ever since the youtube channel 'Soft white underbelly' came to 
predominance. Many who try to find these characters to interview or see what they are. In itself can be a
catch 22 scenario where you can put them more at risk. Also, most who see the camera and see the person
offering something, its almost as they are force to take the help even when deep down they may not feel
deserving. Which may contribute to their shame as not being seen as normal. Of course it varies to person
but overall its best in some circumstances to help without the need of the camera.

Now for the next topic. 

<ins>*".. Being a woman and homeless is another animal."*</ins>

This is true. Women who are homeless almost historically have alot in their plate to deal with being
homeless. Especially if you add addiction or any type of crime they maybe victims of into the equation. 
It makes matters complicated. Some who maybe out of the street are completely alone. Some may get into
relationships with men who otherwise they wouldn't if circumstances were different for any other thing
than protection. 

Homeless Women are run a higher risk to become prosititues as well in order to get through the day if 
they feel that's all they have going for them. 

Back in the day, apart from female hygiene products I may have stacked to give out apart from food. I 
also had referal numbers in case the women needed to get themselves to a clinic for a blood check up so 
they can be tested for anything which include any STDs/HIV. I would also stash some morning afterpill to
give out because unforunately I used to find women who had gotten themselves pregant due to rape and 
needed that in order to not carry the child in a fucked up situation. 

When dealing with women who are homeless and trying to provide aid. Its often good to think outside
the box and try to be there.

Now keep in mind, I may not have all the answers and to be clear, I don't. 
But I would want to at least start a conversation in how to improve the human condition.  

You can improve the small guidelines to how you seen fit and how much you can contribute.

At the end, we are only helping each other.

Plan Of Action

Normally I wouldn't be the right person to write this as I'm currently still trying to process all that
I went through with my friend this year. But I guess for the same reason maybe I can lend a hand and
mention a few things

- Supplies and food
I would recommend CVS, Walmart or Costco to get supplies. CVS / Walmart for any tolietries and/or first 
aid, meds, etc. Now sure in costco you can get much of the same but in bulk. Depdending how frequent you 
may want to help. I would say pack up on tents, blankets, Wipes, Feminine Hygine products, dedorant. 

In terms of food. It would be wise to usually hand out sandwiches or wraps. Its the easist to carry and 
give out without any ultensis needed. You can vary or shift how each aid run you will do Like a week will
be give home cooked food and another week take them something from a shop 

- Gear

When I used to do this endeveor. I would wear a neon vest, same as construction workers would wear. Was it
weird? sure. But I would wear it so its easy for people to see that you are there to be of aid service. 
Now in term of vest color, that's up to preference of the person. I would stay out of using anything 
labeled first aid or EMT unless you had proper training for that or are a certified medical personel. If 
you are an anon and want to put the anon logo in the vest then feel free. It helps spread the message of
anonymous in a different way which is a win win. 

Dress casual with comfortable shoes in case you are doing a check around (which involves going on a walk
on some blocks to see how everyone is.) Carry a simple backpack with you or a black plastic bag to carry 
your things as you do your run. 

Will you be scared the first time you do this? hell yes. It will be terrifying and you'll be nervous
as shit. Which is why you would want to start small. And your best friend in this is in the bus stops that
many homeless may tend to be around just to get by. 

That or a intersection where there's many homeless encampments. The key here is to open repetiore with 
them. If they reject your help, don't take it personal. Just move along and say you understand with 
empathy. 

Also as a word of precaution, take a phone with you that is of an older version or outdated with prepaid
minutes just to move around. You can buy a simple phone for this at your local walmart or if you have one
near you, a dollar store. Also invest in pepper spray for protection too. 

also, for those who drive a car. Leave your car a lil far from where you will be providing aid for. If you
can, just take the bus. 

- Contact Numbers & Resources.

Now this is somewhat important as part of this is to be of aid for the homeless community. 
Know the numbers that you know can be of help like detox facities, local 211 area, shelter numbers, clinic
etc. 

I will list some numbers and links in this writing but there's many of them that I'll take time to fill
the complete list in them. 

211: No matter which state you are, this number will help you get some resouces of help
911: Emergency service (only call them if there's a situation that has escalated beyond your control)
Homeless Directory: https://www.homelessshelterdirectory.org/

Shower of Hope: https://www.theshowerofhope.org/
Shower of Power: https://www.showerpowernyc.org/
Free Clinic Finder: https://freeclinicfinder.org/

- Should you give money or not?
This in itself is always the pondering question. And i'll give you a simplistic answer. If you do give
money that's sort of giving a signal that you'll have money on you every time you go out. If you got it
then cool. If not, just something to consider.
